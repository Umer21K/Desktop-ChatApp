# Desktop-ChatApp
This was my project for Computer Networks 

## Introduction
-In this project, we utilized Flutter for front end development and
Firebase for backend services, including Database, Authentication,
Cloud Functions, and Hosting. This report provides an overview of
how Flutter and Firebase were integrated to develop a chat
application for Windows.

## Technologies Used
### Flutter:
-A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile,
web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### Firebase:
-A platform developed by Google for building mobile and web
applications. Firebase services utilized include Realtime Database,
Authentication, Cloud Functions, Hosting, Analytics, and
Monitoring.

## Methodology
### Realtime Database Integration
-Firebase Realtime Database was used to store chat messages.
-Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending
messages.
-Real-time data synchronization enabled seamless
communication between users without manual polling.

### Authentication
-Firebase Authentication was implemented to provide secure
user authentication.
-Various authentication methods such as email/password were
supported.
-User management and secure access to Firebase services
were handled efficiently.
-Setup email and password authentication using firebase

### Cloud Functions
- Firebase Cloud Functions were utilized to execute backend
code in response to Firebase events and HTTPS requests.
- Functions were written to automatically respond to database
changes and user authentication events.

### Hosting
-Firebase Hosting facilitated the deployment of the chat
application to a global content delivery network (CDN).
-Fast and secure hosting with HTTPS support ensured optimal
performance and security.

### Analytics and Monitoring
-Firebase Analytics provided insights into app usage and user
engagement.
-Monitoring and logging capabilities were utilized to identify and
troubleshoot issues in the application.
